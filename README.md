## Project brief

Develop **Dashboard**, a comprehensive analytics and data visualization platform, as a developmental project aimed at intermediate web developers. This project is designed to enhance coding skills through the creation of a dynamic, data-driven dashboard that serves as a practical tool for visualizing and managing data effectively. It will include various components, each presenting a unique learning opportunity in different aspects of web development, particularly focusing on data handling, UI design, and interactivity.

### What you will learn

- **Data Management**: Learn to efficiently handle and manipulate data, either by fetching from an API or using static mock data. Understand the importance of data structuring for effective display and interaction within a web application.

- **Dynamic UI Components**: Master the creation of dynamic user interface components, such as collapsible sidebars and interactive charts, to enhance the usability and aesthetic appeal of the dashboard.

- **Advanced CSS Techniques**: Dive deeper into CSS to design a visually appealing dashboard with a focus on layout, color schemes, and transitions. Learn to implement a dark mode feature, showcasing the ability to switch themes dynamically.

- **JavaScript Libraries for Data Visualization**: Explore and implement JavaScript libraries for creating interactive charts and graphs, such as line charts, radar charts, and half-circle charts. Gain practical experience in integrating third-party libraries into your projects.

- **Responsive Design Principles**: Apply responsive design techniques to ensure the dashboard is accessible and efficiently usable across various devices and screen sizes, incorporating a mobile-first approach.

- **UI/UX Design for Dashboards**: Focus on the principles of user interface and user experience design specific to dashboards. Learn to organize information in a user-friendly manner, making complex data easy to understand at a glance.

- **Interactivity and User Engagement**: Implement interactive elements such as hover effects on charts and selectable items in lists to create an engaging user experience that encourages exploration and interaction with data.

- **Performance Optimization**: Understand the importance of optimizing web application performance for dashboards, including efficient data loading, rendering optimizations, and theme switching without compromising the user experience.

### Requirements

- [Utilize mock JSON service](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) or static content to populate the dashboard with data, ensuring flexibility in data management for users. Allow for easy integration with APIs for dynamic content updating.
- Implement a sidebar that can be toggled open and closed with an arrow icon. When open, display both icons and titles for navigation items; when closed, show only icons. Icons should be non-clickable, just for presentational purposes.
- Include a top navigation bar adjacent to the sidebar, featuring the "Dashboard" title. On the right side, display a user avatar icon, which is non-interactive.
- Design number cards for Total Income, Profit, Total Views, and Conversion Rate. Each card should display a title, numerical data, an up/down indicator with percentage changes, and a brief description.
- Integrate a "Sales Overview" line chart within a card, including hover effects over data points. The chart should compare two data sets across a timeline, with appropriate labeling on both axes. Find a JavaScript charting library capable of creating line, radar, and half-circle charts.
- Feature a "Sales by Region" radar chart to visualize data by continent within a card.
- Display "Registered Users" with a semi-circle chart, showing the total number of users and the distribution between premium and basic users within a card.
- Create a "List of Integrations" card displaying a table with columns for Application (including logo and name), Type, Rate (visual progress and percentage), and Profit.
- Support dark mode functionality with a toggle switch in the sidebar's lower corner, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes across the dashboard content.
